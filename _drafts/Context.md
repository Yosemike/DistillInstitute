# Hook and why

*What do you do when there’s nothing much to do? - March 2020, Movement Control Order, Malaysia*

Driven by a strong urge to create, I built this blog by coding from scratch with a static site generator, Jekyll and an open source repository, GitHub. Both of these terms were foreign to me before the pandemic that changed so many of our lives. I always look for a craft outside of work that I can build on, from surfing to tango and before we were asked to stay at home, my focus was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Since Christmas 2019, I had been immersing myself in the basics of this martial art. Little did I know I’d have so much fun in being thrown around and choked out. 

Then the lockdown came. It was meant to be two weeks but it went on for more than 3 months. I had to find something new to do.If I came out of this lockdown not gaining anything but fats, I’d be disappointed with myself. 

Here, I document tools I used and lessons I learned to have better health, ideas and productivity for anyone that may find them useful. I post weekly and send a newsletter every Tuesday that include three things I curate that week, they can be a quote from a book, a gadget I discovered, an App, movies that inspired me - all kind of things that add values to my life. I hope you enjoy the content as much as I create them. 

# The joy of starting from scratch

Since I always wanted to have a blog to document my learnings, and I knew shit all about coding, I thought I’d build a blog by coding it. It’s easy to start a blog on wordpress in 2020 but the odd satisfaction of making something on a blank canvas excited me. 

> When your hands are tied, creativity bounds to kick in.

It takes more work but I love the customisation I could have when I build from scratch, like making my own tomato soup, I can decide how sweet it is going to be (not very sweet), setting up my own work station (sitting optional), and now coding my own site: completely clean. They may not be the perfect products you can find off the shelf, but I love that I could call them mine. 

There are many blogs out there, but this one is mine.

3. Sunlight makes me happy.

Apps I use daily to be productive and organised:
1. Things 3 - the “Get Things Done” app
2. Mubert - sounds for focus
3. iA Writer - best
