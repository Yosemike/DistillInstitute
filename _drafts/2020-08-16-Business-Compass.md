# The lie about success

What we were told about success is wrong. There’s no roadmap to success, all we can rely on is a compass. 

Just flip through the pages of Fast Company and you will see most of the featured companies are just that — Fast. 

Hype accompanies new and fresh products. 

They come fast but they also tend to leave fast.

Hype never lasts.

## possible ideas

This is how you can plan your map.

When you have a vision, you must begin with asking why does your idea matter at all?

Is there a vision that you want to achieve that will benefit anyone enough that you get paying customers?

On the other hand, if your idea is of no value, then why are you even doing it?

Next, imagine what is the ideal situation if everything goes according to plan.

Of course, the plan never works out because of Murphy law. Once you have a why and an vision, 

There are many ways that can get you to the destination. 

Before you dive into the market, do research on the following. 


1. Urgency
- how badly do people want or need this right now?
- For example, the demand of face masks sky rocketed after Covid. 
- Do people really need oat milk? 


2. Market size
- how many people are actively looking for your products?
- If there’s a competitor in the market, there’s already a market for it
- You need to find a market that’s worth your while

3. Pricing potential  
- what’s the highest price a typical purchaser are willing to spend?

4. Cost of customer acquisition
How easy or how much does it cost to acquire a new customer

5. Cost of value delivery
How much would it cost to create and deliver it?

6. Uniqueness of offer
How many competitors? How easy to copy?

7. Speed to market
How quickly can I bring the product to sell?

8. Up-front investment
How much to invest before you’re ready to sell?

9. Upswell potential 
What are the secondary offers for the customers

10. Evergreen potential 
How much additional work needed to continue selling
