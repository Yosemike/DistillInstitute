# Why should we care

If you write well, you can tell a story well.J

If you can a story that stir emotions, you have the key to people’s hearts. 

Have a key to people’s hearts, and you can sell them anything. 

You’re wrong if you don’t think you’re a writer or content creator.

You write emails, tweets, copies and blog posts.

You’re a publisher if you have a newsletter. If you’re on Twitter, you’re a marketer. 

What is the one thing that connect us all?

Writing.

Writing connect people. 

Writing matter more now in online word, our words are a representation of who we are.

The better you write, the smarter and well thought you are.

Writing conveys your wit, sense of humour, trustworthiness. It can also make you look boring and stupid.

Writing is not a talent nor a gift only the chosen few have.

It’s a muscle that you can work on, by giving a damn and follow a set of principles. 

Your words are your bonds. Strip away your branding and put yourself next to your competitions, do you stand out? 

What you say and how you say it in writing are your most valuable assets. 

# What is content?

It’s everything your audience interacts with, its everything on your website, social media conversations with them. 

It’s the medium where you communicate with your people, it’s the whole user experience. 

Your content decides if they turn from prospects into customers. 

It’s more than blog posts, product pages and newsletter.

Writing is the core of content.
 
Writing exists in:
- Blog posts
- Ebook
- White paper
- Tweets
- Website text
- Video
- Power point
- Script 
- Infographics

# Why does good content matter?

Content needs to be good now more than ever.

Why?

1. We are all publishers.

Ebooks, emails, tweets, podcasts, webinars, videos, instagram captions. 

We all publish.

Quality content is the best SEO.

Write well. You can tap well into opportunity, if you communicate well with people you’re trying to reach.

Write well and you will stand out from all the crap out there. 

2. Attention span is dropping. Brevity and clarity matter more

You’re competing with the next tweet. Better writing, better impression, better engagements.

It stops people from scrolling, from skipping to another video from clicking buy on your product. 

3. Tell a story well. 

What’s quality in telling a story well. 

It has to serve a purpose, does it inform, educate, inspire, or entertain, that has relentless empathy for the audience. 

**Utility** — you can deliver on your promise to help them. You carry their burden for them, you know their pain and you show them a better way.

**Inspiration** — Content is inspired by data. You have your voice that stands out from everyone else, people will seek your voice.

**Empathy** — You care deeply about customer. They need to hear that you do. 

Utility x Inspiration x Empathy = Quality content. 

# Solidifying ideas with writing

We need to write to externalise our ideas.

Ideas are not solid when they stay in our heads, they need to be written down in our own words so we can connect the thoughts.

Don’t leave scattered thoughts in your heads, link them into a branch of thoughts. 

The act of writing makes it more likely for us to understand what we read, remember what we learn and our thoughts will finally make sense.

# You strike emotions into people’s hearts with better writing

We are human because of story. Back when we live in Stone Age tribes, language evolved to swap social information - gossip.

# What’s your intent?

You must know your intention before you write. Otherwise, your writing will sound unfocused. It will show in your writing.

Make the intent as conscious as possible so your writing doesn’t become rambling. 

The primary intent will decide where you place emphasis and how you order the structure of your piece. 

Decide on your intention, there are usually four.

1. Inform
2. Persuade
3. Entertain
4. Inspire

# How can you level up your content?

Write better.

It signals authority and clarity of thoughts. A person who writes well, thinks well.

It’s a muscle memory. The more you write, the better you write. 

But there’s a quick method to write better right away.

How?

There are just four elements you need to write better. 

Write with simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness. 

The thing about these four dials is that you can’t max them all out

## Tune up these 4 dials:

1. Clarity — easy to comprehend
2. Simplicity — punchiness and pace
3. Elegance — orderly and flow
4. Evocativeness — stimulating

## Simplicity

Good writing or drawing has no needless lines. But, brevity must come from selection, not compression says Donald Murray. We must be a disciplined cutter to be a good short writer.

## Evocativeness

Helping readers to see better with words. 

Use:

Concrete nouns 

Active verbs 

To make the words more vivid.

## Integrity

Don’t use pretentious word.

When you use fancy language, is it because you want to look smarter? Does it serve a purpose? Be honest with yourself there.

Is it vanity or practicality? 

Don’t be immature and childish. Don’t try to impress and it might dilute your writing.

It doesn’t mean that you need to dumb it down. But use it when its needed.

Cut off jargon, be straightforward.

This will come across as honest and sincere.

## Have a strong desire to connect

Don’t alienate your reader. 

The easiest way to do this is to read your writing back to yourself. You will develop a sense of sensitivity that you have for your readers because you’ve put yourself in their shoes. 

You can’t expect everyone in that demographic will understand but you should aim for the majority of your niche. 

The closer you get to them, the more effective your writing will be. You will know the exact type of words and slang that they use so you can speak with them. You will also discover the type of anecdotes, jargon and pace that they use.

Will have a ripple effect and make your writing more powerful.

You will know what to leave in and what to leave out.
