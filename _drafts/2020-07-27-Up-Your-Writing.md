Write better.

It signals authority and clarity of thoughts. A person who writes well, thinks well.

It’s a muscle memory. The more you write, the better you write. 

But there’s a quick method to write better right away.

How?

Tune up these 4 dials:

1. Clarity
2. Simplicity 
3. Elegance 
4. Evocativeness
