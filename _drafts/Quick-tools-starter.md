## Intermittent fasting: stay lean, fit and focused. 

[]()

#### Step 1
Break your day into 2 windows, eating and fasting window. In the spirit of simplicity, set your eating window to 8 hours and fasting window to 16 hours. 

Eating window  = hours that you eat
Fasting window = hours that you don’t eat

#### Step 2
Decide which is more important
Decide which 8 hours will be your eating window, are you more willing to skip breakfast or would dinner be easier to miss?

#### Step 2
Don’t eat outside of your eating window. Black coffee and plain tea without any sugar, creamer or milk is admissible but don’t take too much of either.

#### Step 3
Stick to your schedule

## Ideas - bullet journaling

> Write your thoughts down or lose them forever

Bullet journaling is a journaling method that is minimal and it can keep your professional and personal life in check.

A bullet journal is made up of an Index, a future log, a monthly log, a daily log and collections. And that’s it. I was confused about how to begin when I was starting but turned out to be really simple.

I recommend to watch the tutorials of bullet journaling to begin

If you’re looking to start bullet journaling right away, here’s how. I explain each step with my own journal, I use [Notability]() on my iPad to bullet journal.

#### Step 1 
Get a plain notebook, it can be any notebook, not the ones that are dedicated to bullet journaling.

#### Step 2
Start an index page, I leave 2 pages for index. Here is where you document the important categories in your journal, think of this as your list of files on your computer, except here you add pages to each file.

#### Step 3
Build a future log. I divide 12 months by 4, and have 3 months equally distributed on each page. This is where you put the big items that you know will happen in each month, e.g. wedding, birthdays, holidays etc. It’s your overview of the year

#### Step 4
Add monthly log. You can start bullet journaling from any month. We’re in June now, so put down June, write vertically 21st, 22nd, 23rd ... then the next page is an overview of what’s happening in June and what you might want to move forward to next month.

#### Step 5
Start with your daily log. Here’s where you write what do you plan to do, document your ideas, make notes. 

#### Step 6
This is important. What makes a bullet journal is the keys. Keys are what separate present and future todo, ideas, notes, events. They are simple symbols that represent a category of actions or subjects for you. They are some typical keys that you can start with. My keys are:
