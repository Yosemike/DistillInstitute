Knowledge is knowing how to clean a window, wisdom is cleaning it. And it’s all about cleaning window here, for our clarity and sanity.

This blog is the result of more than a decade’s learning on self-improvement. It’s for those who are looking to grow beyond what they’ve been given.

I built this site because I love to learn but the lessons don’t always stick with me. So I figured it’s best to do extract my learnings that can help build better habits and compress them into tools we can all use here. 

> Time isn’t enough to go around for everyone, I’ll use mine so you don’t have to waste yours.

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement, it’s an axiom I’ll never let die. It’s also what I told 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better person and I’d like to share them with you.

I support these tools from learnings with studies and real life experiences. I also work hard to make sure the content is easy to understand and without nonsense. I dislike writings and tutorials that leave me with more guess works. 

This blog has just three focuses:

1. Health
2. Ideas
3. Productivity

> There’s more to life but upon better **habits** we will build our lives.  

Here’s some tools for you to try right away.

## Stay lean by just tweaking one habit, how intermittent fasting helped me to stay healthy and disciplined for 5 years and counting?

### How to start?
#### Step 1
Decide which 8 hours will be your eating window, are you more willing to skip breakfast or would dinner be easier to miss?

#### Step 2
Don’t eat outside of your eating window. Black coffee and plain tea without any sugar, creamer or milk is admissible but don’t take too much of either.

#### Step 3
Stick to your schedule

## Ideas - bullet journaling

> Write your thoughts down or lose them forever

Bullet journaling is a journaling method that is minimal and it can keep your professional and personal life in check.

A bullet journal is made up of an Index, a future log, a monthly log, a daily log and collections. And that’s it. I was confused about how to begin when I was starting but turned out to be really simple.

I recommend to watch the tutorials of bullet journaling to begin

If you’re looking to start bullet journaling right away, here’s how. I explain each step with my own journal, I use [Notability]() on my iPad to bullet journal.

#### Step 1 
Get a plain notebook, it can be any notebook, not the ones that are dedicated to bullet journaling.

#### Step 2
Start an index page, I leave 2 pages for index. Here is where you document the important categories in your journal, think of this as your list of files on your computer, except here you add pages to each file.

#### Step 3
Build a future log. I divide 12 months by 4, and have 3 months equally distributed on each page. This is where you put the big items that you know will happen in each month, e.g. wedding, birthdays, holidays etc. It’s your overview of the year

#### Step 4
Add monthly log. You can start bullet journaling from any month. We’re in June now, so put down June, write vertically 21st, 22nd, 23rd ... then the next page is an overview of what’s happening in June and what you might want to move forward to next month.

#### Step 5
Start with your daily log. Here’s where you write what do you plan to do, document your ideas, make notes. 

#### Step 6
This is important. What makes a bullet journal is the keys. Keys are what separate present and future todo, ideas, notes, events. They are simple symbols that represent a category of actions or subjects for you. They are some typical keys that you can start with. My keys are:

(To draw) ![]()
* important note/todo
x completed task
- task
. Notes
> future 

#### Step 7 (optional)
