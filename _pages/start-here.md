Knowledge is knowing vegetables are good, wisdom is eating ‘em. And I’m all about eating vegetables here. 

I extract lessons that help build better habits and compress the learnings into tools you can use with ease. 

> Time is running out for all of us, I’ll use mine so you don’t have to waste yours.

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement, it’s an axiom I will never let die. It’s also what I told 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better person and I’d like to share them with you.

My content here has just three focuses.

1. Health
2. Ideas
3. Productivity

> There’s more to life but upon better **habits** we will build our lives.  

Thanks for being here with me, buddy.
