Knowledge is knowing vegetables are good, wisdom is eating ‘em. And I’m all about eating vegetables here. 

I extract lessons that help build better habits and compress the learnings into tools you can use with ease.

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement, it’s an axiom I will never let die. It’s also what I told 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better person and I’d like to share them with you.

My content here has just three focuses. There’s more to life but upon better **health, ideas and productivity** we will build our lives.  

Thanks for being here with me, buddy.
