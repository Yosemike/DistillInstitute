# Want to know the secret of value?

*Value is in what you do, not what you know. Just because you know something, it doesn’t mean that you’ve learnt it.*

To learn something, you must be able to apply what you’ve learnt to benefit yourself or others. 

This blog is for you, if you want to take the express lane of learning and act on it.

I discovered it the hard way after wasting many hours “learning” but the learnings never turned into anything more than “something I know”.

> Knowledge is knowing how to earn money, wisdom is earning it. 

The Distill Institute is all about action, for our clarity and sanity.

## Distilled lessons from over a decade’s worth of learning

This blog is for those who are looking to grow beyond what they’ve been given and improve themselves. If you believe excellence is achieved by deliberate practice and not mere talent, this is for you.

I extract my learnings and compress them into tools to help you build sustainable habits for better health, wealth and ideas. 

> I’ll share what I’ve learnt with my time so you can reach your dreams faster

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement — an axiom I’ll never let die. It’s also what I told the 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better learner and I’d like to share them with you.

I support these tools with studies and real life experiences. I work hard to make sure the content is easy to understand and without fluff. I dislike writings and tutorials that leave me with more guess works so I won’t put you through the torture. 

### This blog has just one focus: help you to learn fast

There’s more to life but upon better **learning**, we will build our wealth, health and lives.
