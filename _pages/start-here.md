# Want to know a secret of value?

*Value is in what you do, not what you know. Just because you know something, it doesn’t mean that you’ve learned it.*

To learn something, you must be able to apply what you learned to benefit yourself or others. 

This blog is for you, if you want to take the express lane of learning and take actions.

I discovered it the hard way after I’ve wasted so much hours in “learning”.

> Knowledge is knowing how to earn money, wisdom is earning it. 

And it’s all about action here, for our clarity and sanity.

## Distill Institute is the result of more than a decade’s learning on self-improvement. 

It’s for those who are looking to grow beyond what they’ve been given. If you believe excellence is achieved by deliberate practice and not mere talent, this is for you.

I extract my learnings and compressed them into tools to build better habits for better health, wealth and ideas. 

> Time isn’t enough to go around for everyone, I’ll use mine so you don’t have to waste yours.

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement, it’s an axiom I’ll never let die. It’s also what I told 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better learner and I’d like to share them with you.

I support these tools from learnings with studies and real life experiences. I work hard to make sure the content is easy to understand and without nonsense. I dislike writings and tutorials that leave me with more guess works so I won’t put you through the torture. 

### This blog has just one focus: help you to learn fast


There’s more to life but upon better **learning** we will build our wealth, health and lives.
