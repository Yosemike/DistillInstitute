Knowledge is knowing how to clean a window, wisdom is cleaning it. And it’s all about cleaning window here, for our clarity and sanity.

I love to learn but the lessons don’t always stick with me. So I extract the learnings that can help build better habits and compress them into tools we can use here. 

> Time is running out for all of us, I’ll use mine so you don’t have to waste yours.

No matter the level of perfection, there’s always room for improvement, it’s an axiom I’ll never let die. It’s also what I told 13 year-old me who loved playing basketball. 

While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about being a better person and I’d like to share them with you.

My content here has just three focuses.

1. Health
2. Ideas
3. Productivity

> There’s more to life but upon better **habits** we will build our lives.  

Here’s some tools for you to try right away.

## Health - Intermittent fasting

## Ideas - bullet journaling

## Productivity - pomodoro method
