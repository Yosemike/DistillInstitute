# Thanks for stopping by

If you’re here, you and I are quite alike.

We share similar dreams and I’m glad we’re on this journey.

Let’s get financially independent.

Let’s get into the best shape of our lives.

Let’s stop denying the world of what we can really contribute. 

Let’s learn so we can bring our dreams to life. 

Together.

Read on and rock on.

# Why are there so much to learn to get richer, fitter and smarter? 

Too much to learn, too little time? 

If you ever found yourself in this conundrum then we are sailing on the same boat. 

When you don’t have a learning system, you have to spend so much time to sift through the fluff just to learn a skill. 

A skill is a means to an end.

If your end goal is to live a wealthier, healthier and wiser life, learning faster will speed up your progress in getting to your destination. 

# Money | Fitness | Productivity

When I started self-education, I wished there’s a place where lessons are compressed into tools that I could use right away for topics I cared most about — **money, fitness and productivity.** 

So I built this site.

Welcome to Distill Institute. I break down the skills to get richer, fitter and smarter into simple building blocks so you can save time and focus on what matters.

## Enter DSSS — The learning system

I found the most effective learning method is the DSSS 

When it comes to learning, the most effective way is to use the DSSS method by Tim Ferriss. 

### Deconstruction

Pick the skill apart.

Break it down into building blocks.

Find out the minimum blocks you need to learn the skill.

This helps to simplify a skill that seems complicated.

### Selection

Apply Pareto Law.

Find out the 20% of building blocks that give you 80% of the result.

These are the smallest actions that have the biggest effects.

Example: if you’re looking to be fitter, doing a 5-minutes of kettle bell swing 3x/week goes a long way.

Remember: this tool is for learning, mastery comes later.

### Sequencing

Which building blocks should you learn first?

Arrange the identified 20% blocks.

Start with the most impactful fundamentals and it will save you from wasting time and feeling overwhelmed.

Example: in tango, if you learn to lead with your chest and you’ll be way ahead of other beginners. 

### Stakes

Commit to real consequences and don’t tempt your self-discipline.

Set a definite goal and a punishment that hurt if you don’t follow the plan.

It can be a bet with friends or announce your plan publicly.

### Learning, in short

1. Deconstruction
2. Selection
3. Sequencing
4. Stakes

Use these 4 tools to learn the skills you’ve always wanted.

You’ll save time.

You’ll acquire a skill faster and better.

And you can bring your dreams to life.

# Your gain is my pleasure

If even one person can take away one tool from this blog to get richer, fitter or smarter, then all my time, money and effort into building Distill Institute would have been worth it.

I post every Monday to start your week. Every Tuesday, I send a [newsletter](https://distillinstitute.com/subscribe/) to share three tools I curate that will add values to your life. 

There are many self-improvement blogs out there, but this one is mine.

Thanks for being here with me.

We’re all fighting against the war against resistance together.

The resistance that fears our dreams coming to life.

Don’t lose to resistance.

Don’t let your dreams die.

I’ve got your back.
