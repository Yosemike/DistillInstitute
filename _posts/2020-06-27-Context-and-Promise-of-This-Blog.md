excerpt: "Here, I document tools I used and lessons I learned to have better health, ideas and productivity for anyone that may find them useful. I post weekly and send a newsletter every Tuesday that include three things I curate that week, they can be a quote from a book, a gadget I discovered, an App, movies that inspired me - all kind of things that add values to my life.

*What do you do when there’s nothing much to do? - March 2020, Movement Control Order, Malaysia*

Driven by a strong urge to create, I built this blog by coding from scratch with a static site generator, Jekyll and an open source repository, GitHub. Both of these terms were foreign to me before the pandemic that changed so many of our lives. I always look for a craft outside of work that I can build on, from surfing to tango and before we were asked to stay at home, my focus was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Since Christmas 2019, I had been immersing myself in the basics of this martial art. Little did I know I’d have so much fun in being thrown around and choked out. 

Then the quarantine came. 

It was meant to be two weeks but it went on for more than 3 months so I needed a project to work on. If I came out of this quarantine not gaining anything but fats, I’d be disappointed with myself. 

Here, I document tools I used and lessons I learned to have better health, ideas and productivity for anyone that may find them useful. I post weekly and send a newsletter every Tuesday that include three things I curate that week, they can be a quote from a book, a gadget I discovered, an App, movies that inspired me - all kind of things that add values to my life. I hope you enjoy the content as much as I create them. 

> When your hands are tied, creativity bounds to kick in.

This blog took more work to build than just using a 
WordPress template but I love how I can customise it to how simple I want it to be. The same way I can decide the sweetness of my tomato soup (not very sweet), my desk setup (sitting optional), workout routine (short) and now my own site - minimal. 

There are many self-improvement blogs out there, but this one is mine.

## Quarantine Stats in sets of threes

**Lessons I learned:**
1. When there’s no change of venue for work, sleep, relax and workout, it becomes more important that we stick to our schedule for each activity.
2. When drained or distracted, shift attention to another task helps to refresh.
3. Sunlight makes me happy.

**Apps I use daily to be productive and organised:**
1. [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (Mac and iOS) - the “Get Things Done” app
2. [Mubert](https://mubert.com/) (Android and iOS)- sounds for better 
3. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (Android, iOS, Windows and Mac) - distraction-free markdown editors for instant thoughts download

Past purchases that keep on giving:
1. [Rumble roller](https://store-rumbleroller.myshopify.com/) - helps to restore mobility and reduce body aches
2. iPad 9.7’ 2017 - it’s so liberating to use just one device to take note, listen to music, read, surf YouTube, write, learn
3. Vitamix - perfect for making my own green smoothies and oat milk
