Past purchases that keep on giving:
1. [Rumble roller](https://store-rumbleroller.myshopify.com/) - helps to restore mobility and reduce body aches
2. iPad 9.7’ 2017 - it’s so liberating to use just one device to take note, listen to music, read, surf YouTube, write, learn
3. Vitamix - perfect for making my own green smoothies and oat milk
