# Ready to level up your marketing?

> Marketing is the battle of perception, not a battle of products.

Drill this concept into your mind to succeed in marketing. 

Many businesses waste a tonne of money on marketing campaigns that just won’t work, no matter how clever the idea, or how big the budget. Adhere to the laws of marketing to not repeat the mistakes.

### Laws of marketing exist
Use them well to get a better chance at establishing your brand and attracting more customers. 

The marketing laws govern the success and failure of products in the market — violate them at your own risk.

Here are some key concepts that you can use to your brand’s advantage.

## Law of perception 

Marketing is the battle of perception, not a battle of products. 

In marketing, there’s no objective reality to the consumers —perception is their truth. 

Most marketeers always focus on doing research and getting facts. They try hard to bring truth to their side, thinking that if they have the best product, they’re bound to win.

But they’re playing the wrong game.

Perception exists in people’s mind — that is the reality that any marketing campaign must deal with. Marketing is a manipulation emotions to shape desired perceptions. 

Truth is illusive. The minds of customers or prospects are very difficult to change. A perception that exists in a person’s mind is often interpreted as the universal truth.

Most marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that you’re fighting a product-based battle. 

However, to deliver good marketing campaigns, you must have a good understanding of how perceptions are formed in the prospects’ minds.

The battle between brands is not centered around its quality, but the *perception* of its quality.

## Law of leadership

Consumers typically perceive the first-to-market brands to be category leaders.

Most of the time, being the first product in the category gives you an advantage over any other better second (or follow-up) product. Consumers often think of Coca Cola as the better product over Pepsi, simply because Coke was the first in the cola category.

The law of leadership applies to every product, brand or category. 

When executed well, the first-to-market brand tends to maintain its leadership because the name often becomes synonymous to the category and common to people. 

The first brand usually becomes the leader, the follow-up brands often try to keep up by copying.

But if you’re a follow-up brand in a category, you’re not doomed forever, there are other laws that you can use to your advantage. Think Kleenex, Pampers, or Tupperware.

## Law of the mind

This law modifies the law of leadership. 

You don’t actually have to be first in the marketplace, you just have to be first in the mind of your prospects.

In marketing, you’re gunning to win in perceptions, not objective reality. So being the top of mind is of utmost importance in marketing. 

The challenge is to get a new idea into prospect’s mind. It’s hard to change anyone’s mind once it’s made up because people don’t like to change their minds.

Love cannot be slowly developed, it’s the strong impression that counts. If you want to make a big impression, you have to blast your way into the prospects’ mind. 

Apple isn’t always the first in the marketplace, but they’re usually first in the mind of consumers. 

## Law of focus

> Google it.

The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in people’s mind.

Your brand becomes successful if you can find a way to own a word in your prospect’s mind. This is the law of focus, your brand boiled down into a single word.

The leader owns the word that stands for the category. Netflix owns the movie streaming service, YouTube owns online videos. 

The essence of marketing — by narrowing the focus, your brand becomes stronger when you reduce the scope of operations. You can’t stand for anything if you’re after everything. 

The most effective words are simple and benefit-oriented. No matter how complicated the product or the needs of the market, it’s always better to focus on one word rather than two or three.
