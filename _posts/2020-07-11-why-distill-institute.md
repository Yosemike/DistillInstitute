## Compressed learnings

Don’t you wish you can spend as little time as possible, and learn as much as possible?

I did.

I always found that there are so much to learn but I needed to allocate a lot of time to research and sift through fluff to get to what I really wanted to learn.

Re: four hour chef, Pareto law

I wish there’s a place where there are lessons compressed into tools that I could use right away for life areas that I really care about: money, fitness and productivity. 

So I built this site.

### Money | Fitness | Productivity

I found that these are areas that I care most.

It’s also the areas that I worked on the most, so I’ve learned a lot. This blog is to capture all that I have learned to help those who are looking to improve in these areas too. 

If you’ve thought about getting fitter, to look better, to feel more confident, to optimise your performance in the sport you love.

Learn to become an expert in any skill.

Get into the best shape of your life.

It doesn’t take much to get good at something.

Why learn a skill. Because it’s fun.

When it comes to learning, the most effective way is to use the DSSS method by Tim Ferriss. 

### Deconstruction 

What are the minimal learnable units I should be starting with?

Break down the skills into small pieces so you can move towards the big picture. 

### Selection

Which 20% of the skills I should focus to get 80% or more of the outcomes of the skill I want?

This is the Pareto law bit, where I need to choose the aspects of a skill to focus on.

### Sequencing

Once you have selected what to focus on, you need to decide on what comes first. This will make your learning roadmap much clearer.

### Stakes

Set up consequences if you don’t learn what you’ve planned, this will push you to really learn a skill. 

Compression

How do I compress the 20% into one page?

### Frequency

How often should I practice?

How do I cram into my schedule?

What are the pains I can foresee?

What is the minimum effective dose for volume?

### Encoding

How do I anchor the learnings into new materials/acronyms for rapid recall for yourself?

## Money

I realised a few years ago that I knew very litt

If you’ve wondered how in the hell is your salary going to let you do what you love and free yourself from the rat race (spoiler: you can’t)

Have you ever wished you can spend less time and do more work?

If you have ever wondered all of the above, then you and I are very similar. 

These are all questions I’ve been asking myself since I left university.

It’s over a decade now after my graduation. 

I don’t have all the answer but I have learned a lot, and I would like to share them with you.

If even one person who reads this blog can use my tools to get fitter, grow richer and work smarter, then all the time, money and effort I put in building this blog would be worth it already.

Your gain is my pleasure. 


# Too much to learn, too little time?

That’s the conundrum I found myself in. 

It always takes so long to learn a skill, and there’s so much fluff to sift through.

I always wanted a place where I can learn the 20% that will contribute 

The more I know, the more I realized I don’t know. 


# I ran out of excuses

I always wanted to write and what I learned to help people. 

It’s a project that has been on hold for way too long. 

“I’m too busy. I have no time. There’s no point.” 

There’s always something stopping me from doing it. 

But I ran out of excuses, I needed to build. 

I’ve been working on self-improvement for over a decade and there are many things I learned. 

Here, I compress lessons into tools that you can use to get healthier, grow richer and work smarter. 

I post every Monday to start your week and send a newsletter every Tuesday to share three tools I curate - they can be a quote from a book/movie, an App or gadgets I discovered - things that will add values to your life. 

There are many self-improvement blogs out there, but this one is mine.

## Tools you can use right away

Taking notes is a hack that m

**Lessons I learned:**
1. When there’s no change of venue for work, sleep, relax and workout, it becomes more important that we stick to our schedule for each activity.
2. When drained or distracted, shift attention to another task helps to refresh.
3. Sunlight makes me happy.

**Apps I use daily to be productive and organised:**
1. [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (Mac and iOS) - the “Get Things Done” app
2. [Mubert](https://mubert.com/) (Android and iOS)- sounds for better 
3. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (Android, iOS, Windows and Mac) - distraction-free markdown editors for instant thoughts download

Past purchases that keep on giving:
1. [Rumble roller](https://store-rumbleroller.myshopify.com/) - helps to restore mobility and reduce body aches
2. iPad 9.7’ 2017 - it’s so liberating to use just one device to take note, listen to music, read, surf YouTube, write, learn
3. Vitamix - perfect for making my own green smoothies and oat milk
