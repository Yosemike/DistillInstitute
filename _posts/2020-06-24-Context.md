I built this blog during the COVID-19 lockdown out of a strong urge to create.

It’s my principle to always have a craft outside of work that I can build on. 

Before we were asked to stay at home, my focus was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 

Like a child, I was indulged in learning the basics. 

Little did I expect I’d have so much fun in being thrown around and choked out. 

It was a little scary at first to be easily beaten by people smaller than me.
