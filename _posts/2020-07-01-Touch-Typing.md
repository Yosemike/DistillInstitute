My best friends - ASDF JKL:

Always trustworthy, they are always there. No matter the mistakes I make, the second I touch those bumps on F and J, I know the mistakes can be fixed, by just lifting the fingers. I know exactly where I am, where the fingers rest, and where they need to go, and where to return to. Without needing to look at where they are at all.

These keys, the tactile feedback that the keys give back. On this, my fingers flow, my mind is freed, when I don’t need to pay attention where to hit, the fingers just hit the right note. I don’t write words, music spilled out from this rhythmical clicks. 

Clickity clickity clad. 

It’s such a meditative thing to do, I never knew that for over 2 decades I have been typing on the keyboard, never would have I thought that it’d be so enjoyable and relaxing to just type, seeing the ideas just come to the screen without having to put in any effort. This is the idea of doing the hard work in the beginning and it will become easy in the future. Of course I am not typing 100++ words per minute, but I am typing with more flow, the friction between me and the input of words is decreasing, I make lesser errors, this is a life long relationship, one where I want to commit to be a good partner. 

This keyboard I am typing now, the iPad Pro Smart Keyboard folio turns out to be my favourite keyboard and not a mechanical keyboard. I love it brings the iPad so close to me, that I can just lift my fingers from the keyboard whenever I want to touch the screen. Instead of reaching for a mouse, I go up and not sideways, I love that I don’t have to depend on a trackpad or mouse, that it frees up my hand. All that I am doing is to be more conscious of my movements when I’m interacting with my iPad, I want my movements to be as intentional as they can be, this experience shouldn’t be one of going through the motion, the iPad is an extension of my mind, it’s a feedback loop. If I reduce the distraction on the output, it will clean up the input source as well. One affects another, it’s my goal to clean up both. That’s why I chose the iPad to be my productivity device and not a laptop, because I don’t have to deal with so many windows at once. 

This is my piano, and words are my trebles and bass, my notes.  I create the rhythm, the music flow, it’s how I let my mind relax, these words that have to come out, I have to make their highway smoother, to transport my thoughts into the blank screen in front of me. In the world where people are looking for more distractions, there are people who are looking for the opposite, something of quality, something that have been treated with care and thoughts, carefully crafted, there’s always an appetite for quality, and people would pay for that. 

Why so few of us ever thought about refining the vehicle for our minds, pay so little attention to what we use everyday, I am guilty of the sin as well, it started as a side project because I wanted to like the SKF as much as I could due to so many people hating it. Since I’ve got it already, I wanted to make the most out of it. Little did I know I would fall in love with it. 

This clickity clickity clad isn’t for everyone, but I love it.

## Touch typing

### Why should we care to improve our typing?

We compromise on our productivity if we overlook the device we interact with throughout day at work and for leisure: the keyboard. 

The frequency of us hunting for the right keys on the keyboard and peeking at the screen to make sure we got the right word has a direct correlation to our efficiency. This constant motion of looking up and down takes away our focus and harms our posture. You also don’t notice the errors you make right away because you’ll need time to steal a glance at the screen.

[Study](https://www.studyfinds.org/office-worker-1700-hours-computer-screen/) finds that an average office worker spends about 1,700 hours a year in front of computer, that’s about 6.5 hours per day. If out of these hours, we can save 2 hours a day from typing more efficiently, we will have the time to spend on things that really matter and are more meaningful.

It’s a surprise that typing courses are rare given how much we type each day. It should be a common standard that we should be able to type efficiently without looking down at our keyboard and having to hit the backspace button so often.

### Enters touch typing

Touch typing let you 

Touch typing is a system where each finger has a home on the keyboard. Wherever your fingers go, they know where to go back. 

It begins with the two bumps on F and J, and the journey runs from the home row, oh my lovely and familiar buddies, A, S, D, F, J, K, L and :. Once you’re conditioned to finding the bump, you’ll know exactly where every keys are in relation to the home row.

You will have less errors in your typing and it will become more enjoyable. 

### Why does our focus improve when we touch type?

Because we don’t need to look at the keyboard any longer when we type. 

Our thoughts and creativity will flow through our fingers onto the keyboard and materialise on the screen with minimal friction. Our muscles are programmed to the location of each key and the typing just automates. 

Our typing accuracy will improve because the typing memory will be built-in. When you’re starting, focus on accuracy and speed will come. 

If we want to have any hope in doing anything quick and effectively, we must first do it right.

### Increased creativity

Once we free our mind from the typing mechanism, we make room for our brain to be creative. In tango, we dance in a way we never knew possible when we don’t need to memorise the steps anymore.

De lutter our mind to give space to creativity.

### It’s not for everyone, but it should

Touch typing takes time and effort to learn. The initial learning phase is painful, just like picking up any skill. You might even type slower than you usually do. 

You’ll work every finger with touch typing. It puts you in a better posture, with your sight always on the monitor and your neck not bent to look at the keyboard.

You’ll find yourself keeping your elbows close to your ribs and your shoulders down to keep your hands better aligned at the home rows.

Touch typing with its concept of home rows opens the door to better posture for office works and those who use keyboard often.

The upside is that we will have access to better focus, posture, productivity and creativity when we master touch typing. 

My typing speed and accuracy have improved since I learned to touch type. 

Here are my stats:

| Speed(words per minute) | Accuracy |
| - - - | - - - |
| Pre-touch type | 40 | 75% |
| Post-touch type | 76 | 95% |
